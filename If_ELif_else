Write a program to compute possible amount available to a student from a university academic excellence scholarship fund 
for undergraduates. There are 4 categories of students: Senior gets 37%, Junior gets 24%, Sophomore get 26% while Freshmen gets 33% of 
the Fund’s amount. Ask user to enter their CGPA. If the CGPA is above 3.5, a 15% is used. 10% and 5% are used for students whose grades
are above 2.4 (but less than 3.5) and below, respectively. The amount available to any student is the product of the student’s CGPA, 
the rate for grade and the percentage of the pool available to that student’s category.
